# luckylotto

A simple 7 number generator to help pick winning lotto numbers. As the lucky dips are never lucky.

Using the random module `luckylotto.py` will generate 5 numbers between 1 & 50 via a for loop, it will then go on to use another for loop to create 2 numbers between 1 & 12 for the 2 needed lucky stars using `randint()`. Which then are both appended to a list to give the result as an example:

Your luckylotto numbers could be [24, 17, 21, 35, 33, 12, 6]
